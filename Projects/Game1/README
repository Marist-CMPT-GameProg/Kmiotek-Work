Hello, and welcome to my first project for Game Design and Programming 1!

This is my projects README file, where I will describe how my iteration of Timber!!! works and the mechanics used within my code.

**Statement of Concept/Theme**

The theme of this game is simple. You are a lumberjack, and you must chop the tree infront of you and collect as many logs as possible within the 15 second time limit. This theme stems from the game "Timberman", which is available to play on steam. Some of the code used to in the beginning of the file was taken from John Horton's text book on game building in C++, titled "Beginning C++ Game Programming - Learn C++ from scratch by building fun games". Throughout chapters 1-5, Horton describes how to build a basic replica of "Timberman", which serves as a great tool for learning how to begin coding games using C++.

**Summary of Gameplay Loop**

The gameplay loop of Timber!!! is also relatively simple, as it is meant to be a starting point for new game programmers like myself. The loop consists of starting the game, chopping the tree infront of you to collect as many logs as possible within the given time, and dodging obstacles such as falling branches and a pesky bee along the way, all while enjoing the scenary and audio of the game. Getting hit by an obstacle causes the game to end, where the players score and time remaining will appear on screen. Players can press the ESCAPE key to restart the game and try again. 

**Statement of Goal/Objective**

My objective for creating this game was to learn from Horton's teachings and get a grasp on programming a 2D game for the first time. I have programmed basic text-based games in the past, but this was a new experience for me, and it took a ton of testing and debugging to get this game to finally run with basic playability. I regret not starting this project sooner, because I had to crunch hard to complete it by the due date. However, I believe my iteration of Timber meets the project requirements to the best of my ability, and I am proud of what I created. my goal now is to only go up from here, and i am looking forward to getting started on the next project.

**List of Player Actions**

Player actions for this game include - Chopping Left, Chopping Right, and ducking. Players may press "ARROW DOWN' to duck, "ARROW LEFT" to chop the tree while standing on the left side, and "ARROW RIGHT" to chop the tree from the right side. There is no free movement in this game. Players chop the tree from two fixed positions.

**List of Hazards/Threats**

Hazards in this game include - falling branches that descend as the player chops logs off the tree, which the player can avoid by moving to the opposite side of the tree from where the branches are falling, and a pesky buzzing bumblebee that passes through the screen on a continueous loop. Players can avoid being stung by the bee by ducking so the bee can peacefully pass overhead, or by quickly moving to the opposite side of the tree just as the bee is about to pass. Being crushed by a branch or stung by the bee is an immediate game over and resets the players score. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this file explaining my game, and I hope you enjoy my iteration of Timber, based off of John Horton's text book and material from class lectures. 

**DISCLAIMER**
Sources such as w3schools.com and AI was used for debugging purposes, as I encountered a number of game breaking bugs that I could not figure out on my own, and hindered my ability to proceed with the project.
